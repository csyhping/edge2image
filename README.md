# edge2image
This project uses a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) to learn a mapping from an input image to an output image.

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Tensorflow 1.4.1,Python 2.7 or above

### Recommended
- Linux with Tensorflow (GPU edition + cuDNN will be better)

### Using Pre-traied model that we have already trained before.
As tarin a model will  take more than 48 hours depending on GPU, on CPU you will be waiting for a bit.
Therefore, we  provided an pre-trained model for you just for testing

### Getting Started
There are also links to pre-trained models alongside for edge2shoes dataset, note that the pre-trained models require the current version of edge2image.py

```sh
# clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/yingcanwei/edge2image.git
cd edge2image
```
Download the Pre-trained model: [edges2shoesModel.zip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14WROFTs4unFS4PfOeSJw7v-YWWxMasao/view)
Unzip the pre-train model and then copy this 'edges2shoesModel' folder to 'edge2image' folder 

```sh
# test the model
python edge2image.py \
  --mode test \
 Â --output_dir edges2shoesDemo_result \
  --input_dir edges2shoesDemotest \
  --checkpoint edges2shoesModel
```

The test run will output an HTML file at `edges2shoes_result/index.html` that shows input/output/target image sets.
You could also check the original output picture file named fileame+ "-outputs.png" extension in `edges2shoes_result/images/` folder.  

### Getting Started from Scratch(Train Model by yourself) 

```sh
# clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/yingcanwei/edge2image.git
cd edge2image
# download the edges2shoes dataset (generated from http://vision.cs.utexas.edu/projects/finegrained/utzap50k/)
python tools/download-dataset.py edges2shoes
# train the model (this may take more than 48 hours depending on GPU, on CPU you will be waiting for a bit)
python edge2image.py \
  --mode train \
  --output_dir edges2shoes_train \
  --max_epochs 200 \
  --input_dir edges2shoes/train \
  --which_direction AtoB
# test the model
python edge2image.py \
  --mode test \
  --output_dir edges2shoes_test \
  --input_dir edges2shoes/val \
  --checkpoint edges2shoes_train
```

The test run will output an HTML file at `edges2shoes_test/index.html` that shows input/output/target image sets.
